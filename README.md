**Orbo**, a naive orange ball, had a run-in with the elusive *Maelstrom*, the don of a mafia group known as "*The Bloks*". Orbo called him "square", and aggravated the Maelstrom. Now, he's after Orbo's life!

Roll away in this endless runner game, <ins>**Orbo's Rolling Rumble**</ins>! Avoid the Maelstrom's Goons, collect coins, multipliers, and even a helpful powerup! 
<br></br>
Can you get a high score?
